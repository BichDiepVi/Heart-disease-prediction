# Machine Learning in Finance project - Heart disease prediction

## Introduction to the project
Heard disease is a common and potentially life-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease are critical for timely intervention and improvement of patient outcomes. The project aims to predict a person's likelihood of developing heart disease based on various health-related features. The predictive model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret the input data.

## Goal of the project
The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then use different machine learning models to train and predictions, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. The objective is to predict heart disease based on a comprehensive dataset, addressing a classification problem with input features representing various parameters. The target variable is a binary indicator, predicting the presence or absence of heart disease. The project utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms implemented in Python to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient.
