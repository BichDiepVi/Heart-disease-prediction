# Heart-disease-prediction
Machine Learning in Finance project

## Introduction to the project
Heard disease is a common and potentially life-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease are critical for timely intervention and improvement of patient outcomes. The project aims to predict a person's likelihood of developing heart disease based on various health-related features. The predictive model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret the input data.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset].
- **Data preprocessing:** 

## About Dataset
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

## Attribute Information:
1. age
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values)
4. resting blood pressure
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8. maximum heart rate achieved
9. exercise induced angina
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
14. The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
