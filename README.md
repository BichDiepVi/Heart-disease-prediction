# Machine Learning in Finance project - Heart disease prediction

## Introduction to the project
Heard disease is a common and potentially life-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease are critical for timely intervention and improvement of patient outcomes. The project aims to predict a person's likelihood of developing heart disease based on various health-related features. The predictive model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret the input data.
